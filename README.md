# RedCogs2.0

## Welcome to my repository for *Red - Discord Bot* cogs.

This repository includes the following cogs for Red:
* BanOnLeave *(Ban a user who was misbehaving and got a certain Role, for example Muted. This helps stopping punishment evasion.)*
* Roleplay *(A cog for roleplay servers, where you can make characters.)*
* MusicSheets *(Shows the sheets for guitar, drums or piano for the current song playing.)*
